# `termc` -- Terminal Collaboration

`termc` is a plain old Unix CLI application. Running `termc` as a host starts a
simple E2E encrypted socket server allowing you to share your terminal's I/O
with guests that connect to the session that you're hosting.

Currently under active development: see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).


# Licensing

I'm currently undecided on licensing. **Because no license has been specified,
I maintain full copyright, as with any other project without a license.** **I
will not enforce my copyright against anyone merely viewing the code.**

In the near future, I'll probably choose between: OSL-3.0, GPLv3, BSD, MIT.

If you really want/need to use the code in this project in the current very
early-stage state, submit an issue and we'll figure something out.
